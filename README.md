## Summary

The project provides a unique functionality related to JavaScript dates. It allows generating recurring dates based on a certain input shape. Its name is in harmony with its essence: the package delivers a functionality of more than just repetitive date generation, but it gives an opportunity to have access to the date of each iteration and generate additional properties based on it.
