<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The project provides a unique functionality related to JavaScript dates. There are some recurring date utilities, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/recurring-date">recurring-date</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment-recur">moment-recur</a> available on NPM. But the first is class based and for second <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment">moment</a> is a must. So I didn't find one that really suited my needs when I ran into the problem of providing such functionalityâ€¤ Eventually I created this enhanced one, which is function based, suitable for TypeScript, and does not need additional mapping.


Of course, it is new and there can be some missing cases of logic. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.
