The project provides a unique functionality related to JavaScript dates. It allows to generate recurring dates based on a certain input shape. Its name is in harmony with its essence: the exported function gives an opportunity to generate additional properties based on the date of the current iteration.

There are some recurring date utilities, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/recurring-date">recurring-date</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment-recur">moment-recur</a> available on NPM. But the first is class based and for second the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment">moment</a> is a must. So I didn't find any package that really suited my needs, when I ran into the problem of providing such functionalityâ€¤ Eventually I created this enhanced one, which is function based, suitable for TypeScript, and does not need additional mapping for extra properties.

If you have some idea about the next features of the current package, please suggest changes by forking the repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.
